<!-- start short-description -->
**ALPHA**: APIs can change dramatically without notice.

Python has implemented `map`, `filter` etc. as functions, rather than methods on a sequence. This makes the result harder to read and Iterators less used than they could be. FunctionalPy exists to change that. 

You get this 🔥:

```python
result = (Seq([1,2,3])
            .map(multiply_by_2)
            .filter(is_even))
```

Instead of this:

```python
sequence = [1,2,3]
multiplied = [multiply_by_2(x) for x in sequence]
result = [x for x in multiplied if is_even(x)]
```

Or this:

```python
result = filter(is_even, map(multiply_by_2, [1,2,3]))
```
<!-- end short-description -->

## Install
```bash
pip install functionalpy
```

## Usage
```python
from functionalpy import Seq

result = (Seq([1, 2])
            .filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
            .map(lambda x: x * 2)
            .to_list()
)
assert result == [4]
```

## Prior art
FunctionalPy stands on the shoulders of Scala, Rust etc. 

Other Python projects have had similar ideas:
* [PyFunctional](https://github.com/EntilZha/PyFunctional) has existed for 7+ years with a comprehensive feature set. It is performant, with built-in lineage and caching. Unfortunately, this makes typing [non-trivial, with a 4+ year ongoing effort to add types](https://github.com/EntilZha/PyFunctional/issues/118).
* [flupy](https://github.com/olirice/flupy) is highly similar, well typed, and mature. I had some issues with `.flatten()` not being type-hinted correctly, but at the current level of maturity, `flupy` is likely a better library.
* Your library here? Feel free to make an issue if you have a good alternative!

## Contributing
### Conventions
#### Philosophy
* Make it work: Concise syntax borrowed from Scala, Rust etc.
* Make it right: Fully typed, no exceptions
* Make it fast: 
    * Concurrency through `.pmap`
    * (Future): Caching
    * (Future): Refactor operations to use generators
* Keep it simple: No dependencies

#### API design
As a heuristic, we follow the APIs of:
* Rust's [std::iter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/)
* Rust's [itertools](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/index.html)

In cases where this conflicts with typical python implementations, the API should be as predictable as possible for Python users.

#### Devcontainer
1. Install [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/) or Docker Desktop. Make sure to complete the full install process before continuing.
2. If not installed, install VSCode
3. Press this [link](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/MartinBernstorff/FunctionalPy/)
4. Complete the setup process
5. Done! Easy as that.
